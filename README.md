# Net-Cat

This project is a recreation of the NetCat tool in a Server-Client architecture. The program allows for real-time group chat functionality over a TCP connection. It can run in server mode, listening for connections, or in client mode, connecting to the server and transmitting messages.

# Features

The project implements a group chat with the following capabilities:

TCP Connection

A server can manage multiple clients (1-to-many relationship).

Name Requirement
Clients must provide a name when connecting.

Clients can change their name by typing "name="newname

Clients can send messages to the group chat.
Empty messages are ignored.
Each message includes a timestamp and the senderâ€™s name.
Example format:

[2024-06-17 12:45:00][Alice]: Hello, world!

New clients receive all previous chat messages upon joining.
Join/Exit Notifications

When a client joins, all other clients are notified.
When a client leaves, the group is informed, but the chat continues without disconnection.

Default Port Handling:
If no port is specified, the server listens on port 8989.

Usage message when no port is provided:
[USAGE]: ./TCPChat $port
Connection Management

Supports up to 10 simultaneous client connections.
Proper error handling for both server and client sides.

Clients can disconnect and reconnect without disrupting the server or other clients.

# How It Works

**Server accepts connections:**

For each connection, func HandleClient is called in a separate goroutine.
A Client struct is created, and the client is added to the clients map.

**Clients interact:**

A client must enter a unique name to join.
Messages are broadcasted to all connected clients.
The server maintains message history and sends it to new clients when they join.

**Concurrency:**

Mutexes (clientMutex and messageMutex) are used to avoid race conditions when accessing shared data (clients and messages).

**Disconnections:**
When a client disconnects or leaves the chat, they are removed from the clients map.
A message is broadcasted to notify others of the disconnection.

**Key Behaviors:**

Limits connections to 10 clients.

Ensures unique client names.

Broadcasts messages to all clients, including timestamps and names.

Maintains a message history to share with new clients.

Handles server shutdown gracefully by notifying clients.

# Instructions

**Prerequisites:**

Go installed on your system.

**Create executable:**

Type in the CLI "go build"

**Run it with this command:**

./TCPChat $port

# Run the server

Start the server on specified port: go run . $port

if no port is specified, then default 8989 is used: go run .

# Run the client

nc localhost $port

# Implementation Notes

Written in Go.
Uses goroutines for concurrent client handling.
Utilizes mutexes for synchronization.
Follows Go best practices for code structure and error handling.
